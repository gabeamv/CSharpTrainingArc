# Pro C# 10 w/ .NET 6 Training Arc 

Reading the book "Pro C# 10 with .NET 6" by Andrew Troelsen and Philip Japikse. 
This repository contains projects that aim to apply what I learn from the book as well as what
I learn from online sources. The main goal is to implement a big project that combines a lot 
of these concepts I have learned. The main big project is called Encrypted File Drop, which 
you can click the link below to know what it is. If I get stuck implementing something for the
main project, or I feel that I don't have a good enough foundation to build a feature for the
main project, I will implement a smaller scale project that addresses the concepts and issues.
I will also implement mini projects, kind of like small exercises, that reinforce what I learn.
These projects may be scaled later in the future the more I learn.

## Main Big Project
* [EncryptedFileDrop](https://github.com/gabeamv/EncryptedFileDrop)

## Projects That Build Towards the Big Project
* [SecureNotes](./SecureNotes/Documentation/SecureNotes.md)

## Mini Projects That Apply What I Read
* [EncryptOrDie (Console Application)](./EncryptOrDie/Documentation/EncryptOrDie.md)
* [CardGames (Console Application)](./CardGames/Documentation/CardGames.md)
