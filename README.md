# Pro C# 10 w/ .NET 6 Training Arc 

Reading the book "Pro C# 10 with .NET 6" by Andrew Troelsen and Philip Japikse. 
This repository contains mini projects that aim to apply what I learn in the book.
ChatGPT use is allowed, but only to supplement my own understanding and to not replace it.
I aim to build my own projects, fuck up on my own, and improve poor code that I had initially written.
